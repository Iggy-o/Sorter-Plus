> *Note from the author:*\
This visualisation was created in order for me to learn more about the inner workings\
of sorting algorithms, before this project I had little knowledge of the countless unique ways of\
sorting objects. Now I thoroughly understand the concept of time complexity, recursive, and efficiency.

## Worst Case Time Complexity

Where "n" is equal to the number of sortable items, in the worst<br>
case scenario it will take "x" amount of time for the list of items<br>
to be sorted, where "x" equals:

- BubbleSort => O(n^2)
- SelectionSort => O(n^2)
- InsertionSort =>O(n^2)
- MergeSort => O(nlogn)
- QuickSort => O(n^2)
- HeapSort => O(nlogn)
- RadixSort => O(n)
- BucketSort => O(n^2)
- CombSort => O(nlogn)
- MonkeySort => O(âˆž)
