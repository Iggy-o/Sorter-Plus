## What is a Sorting ALgorithm

> In computer science, a sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements\
of a list in a certain order. Sorting is also often useful for canonicalizing\
data and for producing human-readable output." (Wikipedia)\

## Worst Case Time Complexity

Where "n" is equal to the number of sortable items, in the worst<br>
case scenario it will take "x" amount of time for the list of items<br>
to be sorted, where "x" equals:

- BubbleSort => O(n^2)
- SelectionSort => O(n^2)
- InsertionSort =>O(n^2)
- MergeSort => O(nlogn)
- QuickSort => O(n^2)
- HeapSort => O(nlogn)
- RadixSort => O(n)
- BucketSort => O(n^2)
- CombSort => O(nlogn)
- MonkeySort => O(âˆž)
