This is where you'll find all my code from the visualizations to the algorithms. 
You can check the algorithms folder for my version of each of the 10 major sorting algorithms,
if you want to see how everything works check the interface folder which is home to the code 
that allows the user to interact with the program. 

And I can't thank you enough for checking this out!!!
